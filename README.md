# Movie-Recommendation-System

The main goal of this project is to build a recommendation system that recommends movies to users. In this project, recommendations are provided based on the movie name provided by user and his preferences and popularity of movies.

* A simple recommendation engine is implemented by calculating weighted ratings.
* A content based recommendation algorithm is implemented using genres, keywords and cast and crew information.
* I have applied the SVD algorithm for collaborative filtering using the surprise library. I predicted ratings of movies using SVD algorithm.
* At last, a hybrid recommendation system is created combining the above two techniques to get even better results.
